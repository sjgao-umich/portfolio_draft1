    <h1 id="wands">Choose your wand</h1>
<main class="woods_container">
    <a name="main"></a>
    <div class="wand-text-block acacia">
        <h4 id='acacia'>Acacia</h4>
        <p id='acacia'>A very unusual wand wood, which I have found creates tricky wands that often refuse to produce magic for any but their owner, and also withhold their best effects from all but those most gifted.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wand-text-block alder">
        <h4 id='alder'>Alder</h4>
        <p id='alder'>Alder is an unyielding wood, yet I have discovered that its ideal owner is not stubborn or obstinate, but often helpful, considerate and most likeable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wand-text-block applewood">
        <h4 id='applewood'>Applewood</h4>
        <p id='applewood'>Applewood wands are not made in great numbers. They are powerful and best suited to an owner of high aims and ideals, as this wood mixes poorly with Dark magic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wand-text-block ash">
        <h4 id='ash'>Ash</h4>
        <p id='ash'>The ash wand cleaves to its one true master and ought not to be passed on or gifted from the original owner, because it will lose power and skill. This tendency is extreme if the core is of unicorn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wand-text-block beech">
        <h4 id='beech'>Beech</h4>
        <p id='beech'>The true match for a beech wand will be, if young, wise beyond his or her years, and if full-grown, rich in understanding and experience. Beech wands perform very weakly for the narrow-minded and intolerant.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wand-text-block blackthorn">
        <h4 id='blackthorn'>Blackthorn</h4>
        <p id='blackthorn'>Blackthorn, which is a very unusual wand wood, has the reputation, in my view well-merited, of being best suited to a warrior.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wand-text-block cedar">
        <h4 id='cedar'>Cedar</h4>
        <p id='cedar'>Whenever I meet one who carries a cedar wand, I find strength of character and unusual loyalty. My father, Gervaise Ollivander, used always to say, ‘you will never fool the cedar carrier,’ and I agree: the cedar wand finds its perfect home where there is perspicacity and perception.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wand-text-block hazel">
        <h4 id='hazel'>Hazel</h4>
        <p id='hazel'>A sensitive wand, hazel often reflects its owner’s emotional state and works best for a master who understands and can manage their own feelings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wand-text-block laurel">
        <h4 id='laurel'>Laurel</h4>
        <p id='laurel'>It is said that a laurel wand cannot perform a dishonourable act, although in the quest for glory (a not uncommon goal for those best suited to these wands), I have known laurel wands perform powerful and sometimes lethal magic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wand-text-block maple">
        <h4 id='maple'>Maple</h4>
        <p id='maple'>I have often found that those chosen by maple wands are by nature travellers and explorers; they are not stay-at-home wands, and prefer ambition in their witch or wizard, otherwise their magic grows heavy and lacklustre.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wand-text-block sycamore">
        <h4 id='sycamore'>Sycamore</h4>
        <p id='sycamore'>The sycamore makes a questing wand, eager for new experience and losing brilliance if engaged in mundane activities. It is a quirk of these handsome wands that they may combust if allowed to become ‘bored'.</p>
