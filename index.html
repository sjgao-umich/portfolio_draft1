        <h1>Welcome to Ollivanders Wand Shop</h1>
        <br/>
        <h2>"Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C."</h2>
        <br/>
        <nav class="index-text-block">
            <p>Ollivanders is a wand shop founded in 382 B.C. Located in Diagon Alley South Side in London, England, it
                is owned by the Ollivander family, widely acknowledged to be the best wandmakers in Great Britain.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>"Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember... I think we must expect
                great things from you, Mr Potter... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible,
                yes, but great."</p>
            <br/>
            <p>"I remember every single wand I've ever sold, Mr Potter. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail
                feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you
                should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar."</p>
            <br/>
            <p>This is where young wizards and witches come in search of the most essential wizarding item: their wand.
                Inside, towering walls reveal thousands of wand boxes stacked to the ceiling. You can witness a unique
                interactive experience and see a wand choose a wizard.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In 1991, Harry Potter was taken to Ollivanders by Rubeus Hagrid in order to get Harry a wand for his
                first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry tried dozens of wands before he was
                chosen by a wand of Holly and Phoenix Feather. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Mr Ollivander said that he had remembered every wand he had ever sold, and he found it curious that Harry
                should be destined for a wand that was brother to the one that had killed Harry's parents, and had
                almost killed him.</p>
